# CaseStudyOfRoofStack

First of all, I created a Firebase project that contains two collections: users and items. The users collection holds the users' information, while the items collection contains the users' order information.
While the users collection has four areas: username, email, created and modified dates, the items collection has userId, itemName, and created and modified dates.
Then, I connected these two collections using indexes. 
After that, I integreted FireStore with BigQuery.

You can reach BigQuery:

Finally, I displayed the orders in Looker Studio. Data Studio has changed its name to Looker Studio.
